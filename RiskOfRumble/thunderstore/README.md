# Risk Of Rumble
Updated version of [MisterKinky's version](https://thunderstore.io/package/MisterKinky/RiskOfRumble/), that doesn't embed a server but connects to a local server.

Connects to supported buttplug.io devices to add advanced vibration feedback to the game. Settings can be configured in the config.  
It's recommended to use the [Configuration Manager](https://thunderstore.io/package/IFixYourRoR2Mods/Bepinex_ConfigurationManager/) to additionally view the connection status and change settings ingame.

Requires a running Buttplug.io server like [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/).
